# Metrics Framework - Client Retention Strategy App

## Overview
This framework defines key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the app's success in reducing churn, improving retention, and supporting business goals. Metrics are categorized into product, user, and development areas.

## Product Metrics
- **Churn Reduction Rate**: Percentage decrease in client churn post-implementation (target: 15%).
- **Retention Package Success Rate**: Percentage of approved packages that retain clients (target: 70%).
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Model precision/recall (target: >80%).

## User Engagement Metrics
- **Active Users**: Daily/weekly active account managers and approvers.
- **Request Processing Time**: Average time from submission to approval (target: <24 hours).
- **User Satisfaction**: NPS score from surveys (target: >8/10).

## Development and System Metrics
- **Uptime**: System availability (target: 99.9%).
- **API Response Time**: Average latency (target: <500ms).
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests (target: <1%).

## Tracking and Reporting
- Tools: Integrated analytics (e.g., Google Analytics for UI, backend logging).
- Frequency: Weekly dashboards, monthly reviews.
- Thresholds: Alerts for metrics below targets.

This framework will be monitored by the Project Manager and adjusted as needed.
