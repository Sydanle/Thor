# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Client Retention Strategy App

## 1. Overview
### Project Summary
The Client Retention Strategy App is designed for an insurance brokering company to identify and manage at-risk clients (those likely to churn). The app will use an AI-driven churn prediction model to flag high-risk clients, store predictions in a SQL Server database, and provide a web interface for users to review these clients, request retention discount approvals from managers, and support future budgeting and retention strategies.

### Business Goals
- Proactively identify clients at risk of churning to enable timely engagement and retention efforts.
- Reduce client churn rate by at least 15% within the first year through targeted retention packages.
- Provide data-driven insights for budgeting and resource allocation in retention activities.
- Streamline the approval process for retention discounts to improve efficiency.

### Target Users
- **Account Managers**: Review at-risk clients, view churn predictions, and submit requests for retention discounts.
- **Managers/Approvers**: Review and approve/deny discount requests.
- **Administrators/Data Analysts**: Monitor overall churn metrics and manage the system.

### Key Features
- AI churn prediction model integration.
- Dashboard for viewing at-risk clients.
- Request submission and approval workflow for retention discounts.
- Reporting and analytics for budgeting.

## 2. Technical Constraints
- **Frontend**: React 17.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.4 with JDK 21.
- **Database**: SQL Server for storing client data, churn predictions, and approval workflows.
- **AI Model**: Python-based churn prediction model, integrated via API or direct calls from backend.
- **Security**: Role-based access control (RBAC), JWT authentication, data encryption.
- **Scalability**: Handle up to 10,000 clients initially, with potential growth.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant.

## 3. User Personas
- **Persona 1: Account Manager (Primary User)**
  - Goals: Quickly identify at-risk clients, understand churn reasons, request discounts.
  - Pain Points: Manual identification of churn risks, slow approval processes.
- **Persona 2: Manager**
  - Goals: Review requests efficiently, make informed approval decisions based on data.
  - Pain Points: Lack of centralized system for approvals.
- **Persona 3: Admin**
  - Goals: Generate reports for budgeting, monitor system health.
  - Pain Points: Fragmented data sources.

## 4. Functional Requirements
### Phase 1: AI Model and Data Storage
- Develop Python churn model to predict at-risk clients based on historical data (e.g., policy details, engagement history).
- Store predictions in SQL Server (e.g., table with client ID, churn probability, risk level).
- Scheduled model retraining and batch prediction updates.

### Phase 2: Web App Development
- **Dashboard**: List of at-risk clients with filters, search, and sorting.
- **Client Details View**: Detailed churn insights, history, and option to request discount.
- **Approval Workflow**: Submit requests, notify managers, track status (pending, approved, denied).
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on churn trends, retention success rates, and budget impacts.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: Page loads < 2 seconds, API responses < 500ms.
- Reliability: 99.9% uptime, automated backups.
- Security: Compliance with GDPR/insurance regulations.

## 5. Success Metrics
- Churn reduction rate.
- Number of retention requests processed per month.
- User satisfaction score (via NPS surveys).
- Model accuracy (e.g., precision/recall > 80%).

## 6. Risks and Assumptions
- Assumptions: Access to sufficient historical data for model training.
- Risks: Data privacy issues, model inaccuracy; mitigated by iterative testing and compliance checks.

This PRD serves as the foundation for development. It will be refined based on feedback from agents.
